# MySQL CMD Practice

This repository documents my practice with **MySQL using the Command Prompt (CMD)**.  
It demonstrates essential skills in database management, including:

- Connecting to MySQL from CMD
- Creating and selecting databases
- Creating tables and defining schemas
- Inserting and retrieving data
- Running queries using `SELECT`

The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to work directly with MySQL from the terminal, which is an important foundation for backend development, database management, and software engineering projects.
